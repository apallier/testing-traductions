# Automating actions is a tactic. It should not be a ritual.
In the Context-Driven world, we reject ritual. We embrace problem-solving. But this attitude is only valid if problem-solving matters. Too often, automation (in both senses—artifacts and enterprise) is pursued as an unquestioned good; stuff that dazzles people even when it accomplishes little. Large tool companies and consulting firms aren’t much help, either: it’s not in their interest to help you see a simpler, cheaper, more flexible way of doing things.

If your testing doesn’t really matter, except as a display for public relations purposes, then maybe rituals are acceptable— but that cannot be so if your intention is to find important bugs before it is too late. To fulfill that mission, you must develop an appreciation of the full spectrum of tools and their applications to your work. Context-Driven testers apply tools in powerful ways to get testing done!
