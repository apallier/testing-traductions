> First: Call them tools (not “test automation”).


> We define a tool as any human contrivance that aids in fulfilling a human purpose. A test tool could be software; hardware; a map, document, or artifact; or some other heuristic that aids in fulfilling a testing purpose. We are primarily concerned with software-based tools, here.

> The term “test tool” connects us to the ordinary, everyday understanding that these contrivances do not work without human guidance; they extend the capabilities of an appropriately skilled human. Moreover, “tool” opens the door to the many ways that tools can lighten burdens and amplify the power of testers.

> Meanwhile, the term “test automation” threatens to dissociate people from their work. To understand why, you must consider what testing is. To test is to seek the true status of a product, which in complex products is hidden from casual view. Testers do this to discover trouble. A tester, working with limited resources, must sniff out trouble before it’s too late. This requires careful attention to subtle clues in the behavior of the product within a rapid and ongoing learning process. Testers engage in sensemaking, critical thinking, and experimentation, none of which can be done by mechanical means. Yet, in our long experience visiting hundreds of companies and teams, we find managers and technocrats who speak of testing routinely ignore these intellectual processes. We have tried reminding them—and our own colleagues, at times—of these crucial elements that cannot be encoded into test cases or test software. “Oh we agree,” they might say, but then lapse back into speaking exactly as if the essence of testing is somehow expressed in their “test automation.” After years of this struggle, we conclude that the term itself is a sort of narcotic.
